Geographical Coverage
=====================

The MFIs Balance Sheet Database includes the assets and liabilities of
all monetary financial institutions (MFIs) operating in mainland
Portugal and autonomous regions - Azores and Madeira.

Population
==========

The MFIs Balance Sheet Database collects the balance sheet data for all
monetary financial institutions (MFIs) that were in operation in
Portugal between September 1997 and December 2017.

[**Comment**]{.underline} : Non-monetary financial agents are not
covered in the database. In case an institution stops to be classified
as MFI, data reporting will be discontinued. Some MFIs in Portugal have
experienced acquisitions and/or mergers, which induced asset/liability
flows from one institution to another.

Methodology
===========

The MFIs Balance Sheet Database has undergone a major revision in
December, 2014 which lead to the reclassification of financial
institutions and counterparties.[^3^](#fn3){#fnref3 .footnote-ref}. Due
to this revision, there are some breaks in the series. The revision also
adds an extra variable that indicates institution type.

To make variables compatible over time, we have harmonized the data
based on the correspondence table illustrated in the [*Description of
Variables*](#description-of-variables) section.

To preserve confidentiality, MFIs are anonymized through unique
identifiers and the instrument values are perturbed for external
researchers.[^4^](#fn4){#fnref4 .footnote-ref}

Description of Files
====================

The MFIs Balance Sheet Database is organized separately for assets and
liabilities in the bank balance sheet (BBS) files. Each row corresponds
to an instrument-counterparty pair in a given month.

The data files are organized with the following nomenclature:

***BBS\_METH\_BNK\_xxxx\_yyyy\_V01.dta***

where *xxxx* denotes the data range (eg: SEP1997DEC2017), *yyyy* denotes
the type of balance (ASSET for asset instruments; LIAB for liability
instrument), and *METH* denotes the method used to prepare the data
(*"A"* for Anonymized and *"P"* for Perturbed).

Identification of MFIs will be anonymized in the data. Additionally, for
external researchers the data values are perturbed.

We also provide a harmonized data set to facilitate the comparison
between the two reporting systems, i.e.Â before and after December, 2014.

Description of Variables
========================

`Bank identifier`

Anonymized identification number for MFI that enables tracking the MFI
over time. BPLIM provides an anonymized version of the MFIs identifier
which is denoted by *bina*.

`Instrument code`

Classification of the financial instrument

The classification of financial instruments was revised in December,
2014. As a result, a new categorization was applied thereafter. Below is
the correspondence table for the instrument codes between the two
reporting systems (aligned based on the previous reporting system).

instrument "Units" (coded 90) is also included in the financial
instrument "Equity securities" (coded 80).

**When calculating the aggregates, to avoid double counting the value
for "Unit" should be dropped.**
