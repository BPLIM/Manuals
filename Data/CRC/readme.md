# Central Credit Register (CRC) Database


This folder contains Data Manuals and supporting documentation for the Central Credit Register (CRC) database. The CRC tracks credit supply (i.e., outstanding credit exposures, defined by a set of variables) reported by all credit-granting institutions in Portugal. The dataset includes monthly data from January 1999 to August 2018. 
The microdata available to external researchers is at the firm and bank-firm levels, while data at the credit exposure level is restricted to internal researchers only.
