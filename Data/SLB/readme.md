# Historical Series of the Portuguese Banking Sector


This folder contains Data Manuals and supporting documentation for the Historical Series of the Portuguese Banking Sector Database (SLB). The SLB reports, on a consolidated basis, a wide range of series on bankâ€™s financial statements (i.e., balance sheet, income statement, and solvency), loans to customers, interest rates, human resources, branch network, and payment systems. 
BPLIM has been producing an annual product based on this data since 2021.
