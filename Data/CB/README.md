# Central Balance Sheet Database


This folder contains Data Manuals and supporting documentation for the Central Balance Sheet Database (CB). The CB provides economic and financial data on non-financial corporations operating in Portugal, with annual data from 2006 onwards. Data was reported using the Plano Oficial de Contabilidade (POC) until 2009, and since 2010, it follows the Sistema de Normalização Contabilística (SNC), reflecting a significant structural change in data organization. 
BPLIM has been producing an annual product based on this data since 2019.
