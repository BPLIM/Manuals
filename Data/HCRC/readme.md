# Harmonized Central Credit Register


The Portuguese Central Credit Register (with the database prior to August 2018 referred to as the Old CRC) underwent a major revision in September 2018 and was replaced by a new reporting system, the New CRC. This new system began collecting granular credit data at the instrument level, as mandated by ECB Regulation (EU) 2016/867 of 18 May 2016 and Banco de Portugalâ€™s Instruction No. 17/2018.

This folder contains Data Manuals and supporting documentation for the Harmonized Central Credit Register database (HCRC). The HCRC aims to create compatible time series between the Old CRC and the New CRC by selecting a set of relevant variables and implementing harmonization measures.

The database covers the period from 2009 and includes information aggregated at the firm and bank-firm levels. Data constructed at the exposure level, mimicking the structure of the Old CRC, is only available to internal researchers.
