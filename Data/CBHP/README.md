# Central Balance Sheet Harmonized Panel Data


This folder contains Data Manuals and supporting documentation for the Central Balance Sheet Harmonized Panel (CBHP), based on the Central Balance Sheet Database (CB), which provides economic and financial data on non-financial corporations in Portugal. 
Data was reported under the Plano Oficial de Contabilidade (POC) until 2009, and since 2010, follows the Sistema de Normalização Contabilística (SNC), reflecting a major shift in data organization. Since 2019, BPLIM has produced a harmonized panel with consistent variables over time, publishing an updated extraction annually.
