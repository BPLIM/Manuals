# Spanish and Portuguese Companies Microdata


This folder contains Data Manuals and supporting documentation for the Spanish and Portuguese Companies Microdata (iBACH). The iBACH provides granular economic and financial information on non-financial Spanish and Portuguese corporations. This dataset is derived from the BACH dataset, which is a database of aggregated and harmonized accounting data of non-financial companies, based on national accounting standards (individual annual accounts). 
BPLIM, together with the Banco de Espa√±a Data Laboratory (BELab), began publishing an annual product based on this data in 2024.
