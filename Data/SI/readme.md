# Incentives Systems Data

This folder contains Data Manuals and supporting documentation for the Incentives Systems Database (SI). The SI provides information on projects submitted to incentive systems funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under the QREN framework (2007-2013) and by the ERDF and European Social Fund (ESF) under the PT2020 framework (2014-2020).
The dataset includes details on both approved and non-approved applications, with all information reflecting the data as of the extraction date.
