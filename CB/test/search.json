    "text": "2 General Information\nIn all files each row corresponds to one firm in a given year.2 All files are available in Stata format, version 18.\nThe data refers to firms located in the Mainland Portugal and Autonomous Regions – Azores and Madeira.\nCB covers the population of all Portuguese non-financial corporations. The classification of non-financial corporations follows the guidelines on the “European System of National and Regional Accounts” (ESA 2010). It includes market producers mainly dedicated to the production of non-financial goods and/or services, such as private and public corporations, cooperatives and partnerships recognized as independent legal entities, non-profit institutions or associations serving non-financial corporations, public independent legal entities, private and public quasi-corporations, and head offices.5\nThe annual data of CB is collected through Informação Empresarial Simplicada (IES). IES is mandatory and contains tax, accounting and statistical information at the firm and establishment level. IES is composed of 21 Annexes:\nCB contains the information reported on Annexes A (Firm Level Data) and R (Establishment Level Data) by non-financial corporations. Firms submit IES electronically to the Ministry of Finance every year.6 The deadline to submit the information was initially set at the last working day of the 6th month after the end of the fiscal year and, since 2009, 7 at the 15th day of the 7th month after the end of the fiscal year. Firms support a monetary cost when they register the financial statements under IES.8\nAfter the firm submits the data, the system implements some validation checks and generates an alert if it finds an inconsistency. In that case the firm has 30 days to correct it.9 Firms may also correct the information previously reported by sending a replacement version of the Annexes along with the “Cover Sheet”. In case the correction is made to Annex A (Balance Sheet or Loss and Profit Statement) or to Annex R (Establishment Level Data), the firm is required to re-send both Annexes even if the information reported in one of them remains unchanged. If the firm changes the fiscal period it is also required to send a declaration before and after the change. The Tax Authority (AT) 10 sends the information collected through IES in an electronic format to the Institute of Registration and Notary Affairs (IRN).11 This institute is responsible for sending the information to Banco de Portugal, National Statistics Institute (INE) 12 and Directorate-General for Economic Activities (DGAE).13\nThe information reported by these firms is then subject to a quality control procedure by the Statistics Department of Banco de Portugal. The quality control is operated at three levels (Banco de Portugal, 2009):\nEvery year around the month of June, after the quality control process takes place, BPLIM creates a data freeze. The most recent version of the data was extracted on June 2024 and includes data from 2006 to 2022.\nThe firm level data in CB is organized in eight files. Each file provides a different type of information, namely:\nWhere A stands for Anonymized and yyyy=2006,…,2022 and eeee reports the extraction date.\nAll files contain a unique firm identifier (tina) allowing the matching of the different types of information by firm. Whenever possible, labels and value labels were attributed to all categorical variables. All datasets are anonymized.\nBelow we provide a general description of the variables included in each of the eight files referred above. The metadata files and more detailed information about each variable is available in the “Auxiliary Files” section. When applicable, we distinguish between variables reported according to the former Accounting System (POC) and the one introduced in 2010 (SNC).\nTable 2- Number of firms over the data period (as of June 2024 extraction)\n---------------------------\n               |  Frequency\n---------------+-----------\nReference year |           \n  2006         |    344,417\n  2007         |    359,638\n  2008         |    369,909\n  2009         |    369,928\n  2010         |    370,692\n  2011         |    379,575\n  2012         |    380,911\n  2013         |    386,118\n  2014         |    391,405\n  2015         |    403,788\n  2016         |    411,041\n  2017         |    425,013\n  2018         |    441,148\n  2019         |    462,126\n  2020         |    479,763\n  2021         |    483,962\n  Total        |  6,459,434\n---------------------------\nThe most relevant legislation for IES that may have an impact on CB is presented below:\nInternal Link / External Link\nInternal Link / External Link\nInternal Link / External Link\nInternal Link / External Link\nInternal Link / External Link\nInternal Link / External Link\nInternal Link / External Link\nInternal Link / External Link\nInternal Link / External Link\nGiven that Central de Balanços provides financial information such as Balance Sheet and Profits and Losses Statement data, the legislation implementing changes to the accounting standards should also be briefly enumerated:\nInternal Link / External Link\nInternal Link / External Link\nInternal Link / External Link\nInternal Link / External Link\nInternal Link / External Link\nFor a description of each variable in each dataset (metafiles) and summary statistics for each data set please check the following auxiliary files35:\nSector Tables (Quadros de Setor)\nInformação Empresarial Simplificada (IES)\nCentral Balance Sheet Studies\nStatistical Bulletin\nThe most frequently asked questions can be found here.

    "text": "5.1 A. Changes in the Accounting System in Portugal\nUntil 2009 the data was reported according to the Plano Oficial de Contabilidade (POC, Official Chart of Accounts). In 2009, a new accounting system, the Sistema de Normalização Contabilística (SNC, Accounting Standards System) was approved by the Decree-Law no. 158/2009. The main goal of SNC is to make the reporting of accounting information compliable with International Accounting Standards (IAS). Thus, all data reported afterwards follows the SNC.18 This is a significant structural change that is reflected in the way the dataset is organized and poses some challenges in the comparability of the variables over time, especially in the Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Statement. The introduction of SNC was reflected in IES in several dimensions, such as:\n\nsome accounting items were simply redenominated;\nsome variables were aggregated or disaggregated, For example, the variables “Statutory reserves”, “Contractual reserves” and “Other reserves” in the Balance Sheet on POC accounting system are reported in an aggregated manner on SNC accounting system in the variable “Other reserves”.19;\nSome tables were added to the survey in 2010, such as, the Cash-Flows Statement and Statement of Changes in Equity;\nSNC introduces different reporting standards for firms.20 In practical terms, this means that Micro-Entities may report some variables at a more aggregated level of detail and be exempt from reporting some tables such as Changes in Equity and Cash-Flows Statement. The variable “regime” in the “General Information” Files captures the reporting standards indicated by the firm.21 In the auxiliary files “variables_*.html”, the column “Accounting Regime” identifies the applicable reporting standards to each variable (N - International Accounting Standards; S - Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards and Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards for Small-Sized Entities; M - Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards for Micro-Entities)."

    "text": "5.2 B. What can change with a new extraction?\nThe CB database at the Banco de Portugal is updated continuously. Firms send IES declarations for the new fiscal year as well as declarations for previous years. BPLIM performs a single data extraction every year. Around June a data freeze is produced to include the information reported by the firms for a new reference year. This new data freeze includes all available data since 2006. With a new extraction the number of observations for a given year may be slightly different. This discrepancy may be more relevant for recent years of the data. This may occur because in the meantime firms may have sent in declarations for years that were missing at the time of the last extraction. Another reason why there may be differences in the number of observations across extractions is if the firm is reclassified as non-financial or financial corporation and therefore it is (in/ex)cluded from the data. It is also possible that for the same firm and year the reported values for some variables differ across extractions. This will occur if the firm replaces the declaration sent at the time of the last extraction (substitution declaration) or if the information is subject to quality control in the meantime. Finally, after internal revision, BPLIM may decide to add new variables or exclude existing ones.\nThe main changes introduced in the extraction of June 2024 relatively to the previous one (June 2023) are:\n\nGeneral Information File 22\n\nnew variable with information about the municipality where the firm is located (concelho)"

This information is required in case the firm reports codes 2, 3 and 4 in sitempresa variable.\nFirm in liquidation (liquidacao) - identifies firms in liquidation. According to the Article 146 of the Portuguese Code of Commercial Companies, dissolved firms are required to add the expression “Em liquidação” to their name while they are in the liquidation process. This variable is created by BPLIM using the information contained in the company’s name as reported by the firm in IES forms. It takes value one if the expression “em liquida” is found in the company’s name.\nShare of turnover of the main economic activity (pervvn) – indicates the proportion of turnover that the main economic activity represents among all the activities carried on by the firm.\nBranch (sucursal) - dummy variable that takes value one for branches of foreign firms located in Portugal. Branch offices are identified using the information contained in the name as reported by the firm in IES and the tax identification number of the company. Notably, the legislation states that the name of these companies includes expressions such as “Sucursal” or “Representação Permanente” (see, for example, Article 21 of Ordinance n. 1416-A/2006 or Article 5 of Decree-Law n. 73/2008) and the firms are assigned with tax identification numbers started by “98”.\nExporting Firm (exporta) - categorical variable created by BPLIM to identify firms exporting to the European Union or Extra-European Union Markets.

This information is identified using the name reported by the firm in IES, given the obligation for this type of firms to include the word “UNIPESSOAL” in their name (Decree-Law no 257/96, December 31). 27\n\n\n7.1.3 A3. Variables created by the Statistics Department of Banco de Portugal\nInstitutional Sector (sectorinstfinal) - reports the institutional sector to which the firm belongs to. As explained in the Sections “Population” and “Methodology”, CB only includes non-financial corporations. Therefore, this variable identifies the type of non-financial corporation, such as public, private or holding company. The algorithm to allocate firms according to the institutional sector is based on the classification of economic activity, the name of the firm and other variables available at Banco de Portugal. Therefore, in some cases the institutional sector may not be in line with the sector of economic activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nDesignation\n\n\n\n\n002\nNon-financial corporations\n\n\n003\nPublic non-financial corporations\n\n\n004\nPrivate non-financial corporations\n\n\n005\nForeign controlled non-financial corporations\n\n\n006\nNon-financial corporations of central government - Enterprises\n\n\n007\nNon-financial corporations of central government - Other entities\n\n\n008\nNon-financial corporations of the regional government of Madeira - Enterprises\n\n\n009\nNon-financial corporations of the regional government of Madeira - Other entities\n\n\n010\nNon-financial corporations of the regional government of Azores - Enterprises\n\n\n011\nNon-financial corporations of the regional government of Azores - Other entities\n\n\n012\nNon-financial corporations of the local government of Mainland Portugal - Enterprises\n\n\n013\nNon-financial corporations of the local government of Mainland Portugal - Other entities\n\n\n014\nNon-financial corporations of the local government of Azores - Enterprises\n\n\n015\nNon-financial corporations of the local government of Azores - Other entities\n\n\n016\nNon-financial corporations of the local government of Madeira - Enterprises\n\n\n017\nNon-financial corporations of the local government of Madeira - Other entities\n\n\n302\nPublic non-financial holding companies\n\n\n308\nPrivate non-financial holding companies\n\n\n314\nForeign controlled non-financial holding companies\n\n\n\nIndicator of Economic Activity (indactiecon) – this variable reports the firm situation revised by the Statistics Department of Banco de Portugal. It is constructed using the information reported by the firm in IES (sitempresa) and complemented with other sources. Notably, it takes into account whether the firm contracts new loans, maintains commercial transactions with firms abroad or pays and settles the Value Added Tax, among others.\n\n\n\nCode\nDesignation\n\n\n\n\n0\nUnknown\n\n\n10\nAwaiting business start\n\n\n20\nIn business\n\n\n30\nSuspended activity\n\n\n40\nCeased activity\n\n\n97\nInvalid\n\n\n98\nNot specified\n\n\n\nDimension Category (dimcomissao) - this variable classifies firms according to four dimension categories following the Commission Recommendation 2003/361/CE28:\n\n\n\nCode\nDesignation\n\n\n\n\n1\nMicroenterprises\n\n\n2\nSmall enterprises\n\n\n3\nMedium-sized enterprises\n\n\n4\nLarge enterprises\n\n\n\nThis classification is based on the number of employees and either total turnover or assets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany category\nStaff headcount\nand\n(Turnover\nor\nBalance sheet total)\n\n\n\n\nMedium-sized\n&lt;250\nand\n(\\(\\leq\\) €50 m\nor\n\\(\\leq\\) €43 m)\n\n\nSmall\n&lt;50\nand\n(\\(\\leq\\) €10 m\nor\n\\(\\leq\\) €10 m)\n\n\nMicro\n&lt;10\nand\n(\\(\\leq\\) €2 m\nor\n\\(\\leq\\) €2 m)\n\n\n\nSource: European Commission\nFounding year (ancon) – corresponds to the year of business start according to the Indicator of Economic Activity (indactiecon). This information is complemented with the founding date reported in the Central Registry of Companies.\nMunicipality (concelho) – provides information on the municipality in which the firm is located. The classification of this variable is according to DICOFRE and differs from the Code of the administrative division for Autonomous Regions. For a complete list of codes see the metadata file CB_meta_YFRM_JUN24_ROSTO_V01.\nThe Stata package coconuts available in BPLIM’s Github repository allows to convert the Portuguese municipality classification to the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS).\n\n\n7.1.4 A4. Variables extracted from Central Registry of Companies (Ministry of Justice)\nLegal form (natju) – this variable reports firm’s legal form. For a complete list of codes see the metadata file CB_meta_YFRM_JUN24_ROSTO_V01.\nSector of Activity (cae21, cae3, caekotu):\nMain Sector of Activity (cae21 and cae3) - reports firm’s main sector of activity. The criteria to define the main sector of activity is the gross value added at factor cost. When it is not possible to use this information to define the main sector of activity, firms are requested to use turnover or the number of people permanently employed by the firm. From 2006 to 2008, firms reported the code of “The Portuguese Classification of Economic Activities - Revision 2.1” (CAE Rev. 2.1) at the highest level of disaggregation. Since 2008, firms report their main activity according to the “The Portuguese Classification of Economic Activities - Revision 3” (CAE Rev. 3). The Statistics Department of Banco de Portugal provides the information on the main sector of activity according to both classifications CAE Rev. 2.1 and CAE Rev. 3 whenever possible. The source of this information is the CAE registered in the “Central Registry of Companies” for each company. Whenever the correspondence is not unique, the match between codes CAE Rev. 2.1 and CAE Rev. 3 is implemented based on the highest frequency of the matches.29 For a complete list of codes see the metadata file CB_meta_YFRM_JUN24_ROSTO_V01.\nThe main sector of activity is reported at the highest disaggregation level (5 digit) and can be aggregated using the Stata package validarcae available in the SSC.\nCAE sections K, O, T or U (caekotu) - this variable was created by BPLIM using the information in cae3 (Classification of Economic Activity Rev. 3). It takes value one if the main economic activity of the firm is within one of the following sections of economic activity:\n\nK- Financial and insurance activities,\nO-Public administration and defence; compulsory social security,\nT-Activities of households as employers; undifferentiated goods- and services-producing activities of households for own use,\nU-Activities of extraterritorial organizations and bodies.\n\nThis variable allows for the identification of the cases in which the information on the sector of economic activity reported by the firm is not in line with the institutional sector to which the firm is allocated by the Statistics Department of Banco de Portugal. This may happen because Banco de Portugal uses complementary sources of information besides the classification of economic activities to classify firms as non-financial corporations."

Corporate Actions File\nThe Corporate Actions files contain information on firm actions that occurred during the fiscal period altering the structure of the firm and affecting the comparability of the economic and financial information over time. This table is subject to quality control by the Statistics Department of Banco de Portugal and relies on the information reported in IES and other complementary sources. The data has a significant but not exhaustive coverage of the corporate actions that have an impact on the structure of the non-financial corporations included in CB.\n\n7.8.1 E1. Identifiers\nFirm identifier (tina_origem, tina_destino) – firm identification codes that enable identifying the firm of origin and the firm of destination of the corporate action.\ntina_origem - firm of origin’s anonymized tax identification number,\ntina_destino - firm of destination’s anonymized tax identification number.\nReference year of the data (ano) – Reference year of the data.\nNumber of order of the corporate action (numordem): Corporate action’s number of order.\n\n\n7.8.2 E2.

Relevant Definitions\nNumber of months of activity interruption (mesesparagem) - number of months the firm interrupted its activity. This variable is only filled in when the type of corporate action corresponds to an activity interruption (tipoacont=30).\nEffect on data comparability (efeitopessoal, efeitobalanco, efeitodemresult, efeitocontas) - set of dummy variables stating whether the corporate action has an effect on data comparability. By default, it is considered that the corporate action has an effect on data comparability if the relative annual change of the relevant variable (Number of Paid and Unpaid Employees, Total Assets or Turnover) exceeds 10%. After the quality control takes place, however, the action may be considered to have or not an effect on data comparability according to the analysis of the firm’s information.\nefeitopessoal - dummy variable taking value one (“Yes”) if the corporate action has an impact on the Number of Paid and Unpaid Employees.33\nefeitobalanco - dummy variable taking value one (“Yes”) if the corporate action has an impact on Total Assets.\nefeitodemresult - dummy variable taking value one (“Yes”) if the corporate action has an impact on Turnover.\nefeitocontas - dummy variable taking value one (“Yes”) if the corporate action has an impact on the overall economic and financial statements.\n\n\n7.8.3 E3. Relevant definitions\nMerge- This corporate action occurs if two or more companies combine into a newly created company or an existing one. In this last case, the firm is simultaneously the Firm of Origin and the Firm of Destination.\nSplit – This corporate action occurs when a company divides its activity into two or more existing and/or newly created companies. If the firm splitting its activity stay in business then this firm is simultaneously the Firm of Origin and the Firm of Destination.\nChange of Economic Activity (with/without the creation of a new firm) - structural change on the firm affecting the comparability of the information over time. For example, a firm being assigned a new Tax Identification Number due to changes in firm’s legal form, sector of activity or institutional sector.\nDissolution of a significant part of productive assets without split - significant diminution in the economic activity of the firm that is not explained by the transfer of productive assets to an existing or newly created firm."
