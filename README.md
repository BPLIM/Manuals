<p>This folder contains the markdown versions of the manuals for each of BPLIM's datasets.</p> 
<p>The folder is used for
versioning purposes, but you are free to compile the manual yourself. In order to do this, you will need to 
install <a href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html">pandoc</a> and convert the markdown files to html.</p>
<p>As an example, you can download and unzip the file example.zip and, after the file is unzipped, double-click on the file
<i>createhtml.bat</i>. Please note that this batch file was created with this folder structure in mind, so in order for the compilation to be 
successful, you have to mantain it. Also keep in mind that for other manuals the commands for compiling the html version of the manual
will certainly be different.</p>
