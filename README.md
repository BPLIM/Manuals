# BPLIM Manuals

This folder contains the markdown versions of manuals created by BPLIM.

The folder is used for versioning purposes, but in each folder we provide a batch file that allows you to create an *html* or *pdf* version of the manuals. In order to do this you will need to install <a href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html">pandoc</a>. 
Please note that all batch files assume that you preserve the same folder structure as in Github. Also keep in mind that some of the manuals for datasets may ommit some descriptive statistics. In that case we will only report the Stata commands, but not the output of the analysis. The full version of the manuals is made available in the BPLIM servers
