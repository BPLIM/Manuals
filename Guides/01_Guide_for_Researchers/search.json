    "text": "1 General Remarks\nThe Banco de Portugal Microdata Research Laboratory (BPLIM) is part of the Economics and Research Department (DEE) of Banco de Portugal (BdP) and was created with the objective of facilitating researchers’ access to and use of micro datasets about the Portuguese economy. Primarily, these are datasets owned by BdP, but there are other datasets supplied by third parties. Data can only be accessed on BPLIM’s External Server or in the internal infrastructure of the bank. The External Server has remote access capabilities and is intended for use by external researchers. Internal researchers (those with a contractual link to BdP) have access to a scalable computational platform (Pitagoras) and to a data repository created by BPLIM, which can be used without restrictions."

    "text": "2.1 What are the characteristics of BPLIM’s datasets?\nAll BPLIM datasets created for research purposes are stripped of elements that allow for direct identification of companies, banks, or individuals. Whenever possible, the datasets contain unique unit identifiers common across datasets: examples of these are tina – the tax identification number anonymized for companies – and bina – the bank identification number anonymized. \nBy default BPLIM datasets are made available in Stata format. Larger datasets may be made available in parquet format. Data is stored in an efficient way that minimizes file size and follows BPLIM’s naming convention. Labels are applied to all variables and value labels to all categorical variables. Whenever possible, labels can be displayed in Portuguese and English.\nAll datasets are accompanied by a Manual that contains all relevant information regarding the data. The data manuals, the metafiles1 and citation information for the different data extractions are available on GitHub. A metafile that contains additional descriptive statistics for each dataset can be obtained once researchers are given access to the server. Please refer to the External Server Guide on how to access this information. \nBPLIM datasets may also have companion script files that calculate additional variables or harmonized variables to guarantee comparability over time and across datasets. Datasets are updated regularly based on a data extraction (“data freeze”) at a specific point in time, and a versioning system is applied to reflect any changes to the data set. Most datasets have an associated Digital Object Identifier (DOI)."

The repository makes available data, which can be used unreservedly for research and policy activities without any formality. However, data made available strictly for policy should not be used for research because as it may have lower quality, are not documented, and may not be reproducible. If Internal Researchers are working with external co-authors or if they need to use or link other micro datasets not available in the data repository they will need to submit a project to BPLIM.\nExternal Researchers must always submit a project. The project proposal must: (1) contain a short description of the research project; (2) identify all participants involved in the project along with their affiliations, and include a curriculum vitae (CV) for each; and (3) specify the datasets, timeframe, and variables required. All external researchers with access to the data are required to sign a confidentiality agreement. If the project consists of a master or doctoral dissertation then the supervisor(s) has to be identified and must also sign the confidentiality agreement. BPLIM staff can collaborate with the researcher(s) to identify the required datasets and, if necessary, construct a customized dataset. A copy of the required documents can be found in BPLIM’s website."

Internal researchers can log into Pitagoras from their terminal using their network login credentials. External researchers will be provided with a login and password for Pitagoras and granted access to a terminal where it is technically restricted to transfer, download, copy, paste, or print any data. BPLIM projects at Pitagoras are placed in a specific folder containing all projects, with users having access only to their designated project folder.\nFor more details on accessing BPLIM projects in Pitagoras, please refer to the BPLIM Pitagoras Manual. Due to a limited number of terminals available, external researchers must book their visits well in advance.\nIf the account is on the External Server, then the data must be accessed remotely (“remote access”) using a secure connection. BPLIM uses the NoMachine software for this purpose. With this connection, it is not possible to exchange files between the external server and the local computer. For more details on using the External Server, please refer to the External Server Guide.\nIn special circumstances explained below, the external researcher may be granted indirect access to the data (“surrogate access”, also known as, “remote execution”). With surrogate access, there is no need for the external researcher to have an account, as BPLIM staff (or an internal researcher) will act as a proxy for data access. This means that BPLIM staff (or an internal researcher) will execute the scripts written by the external researcher and share the outputs after disclosure control."

    "text": "3.5 What type of anonymization is applied to BPLIM’s datasets?\nWhen BPLIM makes its datasets accessible to researchers, it uses several different strategies to anonymize the data. The type of anonymization depends on the specific data and the user. BPLIM uses four levels of anonymization:\n\nLevel 1 - All information that could lead to the direct identification of statistical units (firms/banks/individuals) is omitted, and unique identifiers (e.g., NIF, bank ID) undergo a 1-to-1 transformation to new identifiers that are specific to the project. Level 1 datasets will contain “_A_” in the name.\nLevel 2 - in addition to Level 1, the values of variables containing sensitive information will be replace by modified values, which are random values that exhibit some correlation with the original values. The file name of a Level 2 dataset will contain “_P_”, and the labels of the modified variables will reflect this information.\nLevel 3 - in addition to Level 2, variables may be sorted randomly and independently to break the link between the observations. Level 3 datasets will be identified with “_R_”.\nLevel 4 - a subset of the data is generated randomly (pseudo-data), respecting only the metadata and the time structure of the original data. Level 4 datasets will be identified with “_D_” in their name.\n\nDatasets of Level 2, 3, or 4 are generically designated as modified datasets.\nLevel 4 datasets are the only ones that researchers are allowed to use outside of the bank computing environment, because the values generated for this level are fictitious."

The exception is if the Internal Researcher is accessing the data through the External Server. In that case, Internals Researchers have the same access conditions as External Researchers.\nDatasets made available to External Researchers are subject to a confidentiality classification as follows: low, medium, or high. If the data are classified as low, then the data is anonymized at Level 1. Datasets classified as medium may be anonymized at Level 2 or 3, depending on the risk of identification.

Results of analysis performed on “modified” datasets are not valid for research purposes. However, external researchers can always request to have their scripts run on the original datasets. This rule applies whether the access is “on-site” or “remote”. Researchers working with modified data should use BPLIM’s Replication App. For instructions on how to use the Replication App, please refer to the Replication App User Guide. While not strictly enforced, use of the BPLIM’s Replication App, will ensure that the replication on the original data is implemented correctly and in a much more timely manner. We strongly encourage use of the BPLIM’s Replication App.\nResearchers working with Level 4 data (pseudo-data) in their personal computers, will receive a package along with instructions to create the pseudo-data.

In such mixed projects, where the external researcher does not have access to the original, the internal researcher is responsible for ensuring that the information shared with their external co-authors complies with the confidentiality requirements associated with the data.\nIn these cases, BPLIM will open a second “parallel” account with access only for the internal researcher(s) and place all the original (anonymized) data there. It will be the responsibility of the internal researcher to execute all scripts on the original data stored in this “parallel” account.\nFurthermore, it will be their responsibility to ensure that external researchers do not have any access to confidential data. Specifically, external co-authors must not access the project account containing the original data, the internal co-author’s desktop computer, or any logs that may contain confidential information.\nIn a mixed project all interaction with BPLIM should be done via the internal researcher."

In that case the external researcher needs to submit a detailed project to BPLIM. The project will be evaluated according to the relevance of the topic to the research agenda of BdP. Only projects deemed relevant will be granted surrogate access. If BPLIM decides to support the project, external researchers will be assigned a data expert at BPLIM, who will collaborate with them to prepare and run scripts on the original data. However, the coding itself remains the ultimate responsibility of the external researcher, and BPLIM will not validate or certify the scripts written by the researcher. External researchers are encouraged to work closely with BPLIM staff to ensure they achieve the intended results and are also encouraged to discuss their findings with BPLIM staff. It is highly recommended that external researchers initiate their project with a short-stay visit in BPLIM, during which time they can discuss their research with BPLIM staff and gain a thorough understanding of the data complexities. Additional visits throughout the project are also encouraged. All outputs shared with the external researcher are subject to the usual disclosure restrictions."

Thus, they are free to place external files in their Pitagoras accounts. However, if the external data needs to be merged with BPLIM datasets using an anonymized key, then the internal researcher must be working in a BPLIM project account at Pitagoras. They will also need to fill in an application for using an external dataset (see below). BPLIM will anonymize the external datasets using the same linking key as the one used for the BPLIM datasets. Note that BPLIM identifiers (eg: tina and bina) are specific to a project and are not valid to link files exchanged between accounts.\nIf the account is shared with external researchers - a “mixed project” - the internal researcher must ensure that external researchers are allowed access to the external dataset and that they do not gain undue access to confidential data. At the request of the internal researcher, BPLIM will anonymize/modify the external datasets intended for use in “mixed projects”.\nExternal researchers may also request that external data files be placed in their accounts. BPLIM staff will assist if there is a need to merge external datasets with BPLIM datasets. External datasets typically contain aggregated data, but it may be possible to add external datasets with finer granularity. BPLIM staff will assess if the addition of the external datasets increases the risk of identification of individual observations. In such cases, additional measures will be undertaken to ensure that the confidentiality of the data is preserved once external files are merged with existing BPLIM datasets. These situations will be analyzed case by case and discussed with BPLIM staff.\nAll external datasets provided to BPLIM should be in a Stata or CSV format and an External Datasets Form must be filled in. In the form, researchers are required to explain the data provenance, provide a justification for its use, and identify the key variables that enable linking the external dataset with BPLIM’s datasets. The researcher must also certify that all researchers with access to the account are authorized to use the data.

This responsibility solely rests with the researcher.\nOutput logs should never contain information that discloses individual dataset records; they should only include aggregate-level information. Therefore, listings of individual records, tables with cells derived from manipulation of three or fewer observations, statistical measures with standard errors of zero, minimum and maximum values, etc., are prohibited.\nPlain text files (including Latex and comma or tab separated values) are the preferable formats, although other formats may be accepted provided that the data content can be easily verified. Graphical outputs should be generated in “.png” format.\nIn mixed projects, the internal researcher is responsible for ensuring adherence to these principles. BPLIM will assist in this process upon request from the internal researcher. For projects involving only external researchers, BPLIM staff will verify the conformity of all outputs.\nOutput disclosure control depends on staff availability and may take longer in periods of high workload. BPLIM staff will only answer requests for output extraction sent by email and will take the necessary time to ensure that all confidentiality requirements are safeguarded. Researchers should keep their output requests to a minimum and, whenever feasible, these requests should be of final outputs.\nFor further details, please refer to the Output Control Guide."
